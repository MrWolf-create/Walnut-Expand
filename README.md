# Walnut-Expand
This is about expanding ones mind and learning new skills.

The plan is to mesh up to date hardware running up to date code into my manufactureing proceses.
Using my skills as a inventer of things and systoms, intergrating eletronics with modern furniture
and Cabnetry applicatons. The project is exiting and has the potentual to grow into something amazing.
With IITO (Indistry IOT) being the fastest growing inderstry in the world, It is my intention to get in
on the action. Hence I have drafted my first two prototype cabnets based around Two factors that play an
important part of my buisness, Stock invintry and Tool management. The consumable content has never ben
tracked propely as this needs to be tracked in real time, the basic concept is to have a RFID tag systom
to access the cabnet, This giving the detale of the Staff member accessing stock, the interface start screen 
inside the cabnet would then have a welcome note come onto the interface, then would have the job codes of the
works that was asigned with the option to change this field (Workshop-Other option, with note attached), 
All stock will have a barcode and be scaned with a handheld reader. This giving the Three fields of 
information required, Person-Job-Stock (to be booked to the job), this way the informaton is being caught
in real time. The Tool managment Cabnet/Cabnets would have a simmila systom, the tool would have the staff
members detale so could be tracked propely. The project is still in its infint stages as i am gathering 
the hardware and electronics needed to implement this sistym. Having gathered enough bits and peaces now
i am getting into the more tricky parts of the equasion, the code... and this is why i am Here, To refign
yet another skillset, coading and meshtronics.  

I am looking forwards to colaberating with other likeminded soles whom wish to get involved with myself
and my crew in the devalopment and designing of indistry based smart Cabnets and infistructure with the
intentions of making things more streamlined and less stress for all partys concerned, From the lad whom 
sweeps the floor thru to the company stakeholders. This project is about getting the inforstructure up to 
pace with the modern times we are living in now.
